this project is based on the stanford university's open course:
CS142 Web Applications(2012).

this is project 1, use Css control web's html elements.

at p1a.css stil have some problems as below:
1. in every row in the table, seems can not use <div class="xxx"> tag 
   to mark a apart to define style.
2. there is misunderstanding in css's box model, such as margin, padding.
	so i can't gvie every row a white bottom line.
3. each cell in the table, have a margin(8px) before items contain in.
